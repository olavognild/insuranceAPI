General explanation of code:

Id's are used for fetching DOM elements
Classes are used for styles

For simplicity's sake texts in this case are not translated/handled. They are hardcoded in swedish.

Implementation:
For this task I've chosen to work with vanilla js and jQuery/Ajax to fetch data from an API. To pass data between pages data are saved in the localstorge.
If this project would have been completed used a javascript framework such as SiteVision WebApps or ReactJS, passing data would not have been implemented
this way. Instead rendering a new component with its associated data would have been done.
